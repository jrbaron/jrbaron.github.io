# About
Hi! I am Jessica Baron, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science, [Visual Computing at Clemson University](https://computing.clemson.edu/vcl/) advised by [Dr. Eric Patterson](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~ekp/).
My research focus is on material modeling for rendering feathers in computer graphics.
I am passionate about the paths that the field of graphics opens up for interdisciplinary and international efforts for understanding more of the physical world.

I am a 2020-2021 Fulbrighter at Prof. Wenzel Jakob's [Realistic Graphics Lab (RGL)](http://rgl.epfl.ch) at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland.
I spent time abroad, too, in Cologne, Germany at TH KÃ¶ln and in Wellington, New Zealand at Weta Digital; at both places I developed tools for procedurally generating feather geometry.
I additionally interned with the RenderMan team at Pixar Animation Studios (implementing material models) and the Unreal Engine team at Epic Games (implementing rendering data structures).
